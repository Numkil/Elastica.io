[Elastica 2.0.0](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/2.0.0) ([download](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/releases/tag/2.0.0)). This release is compatible with elasticsearch 1.5.2.

## Release Notes
With this release Elastica moves to its own independent semantic versioning. It starts with the jump from Elastica v1.4.3.0 to 2.0.0. The compatible elasticsearch version will be linked with every release. This changes makes it possible to better indicate major branches to previous Elastica versions without being dependent on elasticsearch release version numbering. The v in front of the version was dropped.

Release 2.0.0 has only minor backward compatibility breaks (see below), but lots of improvements and additions. All BC changes are related to changes in elasticsearch 1.5.*. Migration from v1.4.3.0 to 2.0.0 should not be an issue in most cases even though it is a big step concerning version number.

The goal is also to improve on the release notes to make it easier to see what changes and what are the backward compatible changes. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/issues/833)
