[Elastica 2.3.0](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/2.3.0) ([download](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/releases/tag/2.3.0)). This release is compatible with elasticsearch 1.7.2.

As this release breaks backward compatibility, a detailed explanation about the breaking changes can be found [here](/2015/09/22/elastica-2-dot-3-0-broken-backward-compatibility-explanation/)

### Backward Compatibility Breaks
- Objects do not casts to arrays in setters and saved in params as objects. There is many side effects if
  you work with params on "low-level" or change your objects after you call setter with object
  as argument. [#916](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/916)

### Added
- Add Script File feature #902 #914

### Improvements
- Support the http.compression in the Http transport adapter #515
- Introduction of Lazy toArray [#916](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/916)
- Update Elasticsearch dependency to 1.7.2 [#929](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/929)
