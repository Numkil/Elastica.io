[Elastica 3.2.0](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/3.2.0) ([download](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/releases/tag/3.2.0)).

This release is compatible with Elasticsearch 2.x and was tested with [elasticsearch 2.3.2](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/release-notes-2.3.2.html).


## Backward Compatibility Breaks

The BC breaks in this release only affect implementations which modified / extended the ResultSet class.

- Method \Elastica\ResultSet::create and property \Elastica\ResultSet::$class were removed. To change the ResultSet class, implement your own ResultSet Builder. #1065
- Properties on \Elastica\ResultSet _totalHits, _maxScore, _took and _timedOut that were originally set on object construction are now accessed by the getters on the ResultSet. #1065

## Bugfixes
- Fix php notice on `\Elastica\Index::getAliases()` if index has no aliases #1078

## Added
- Update elasticsearch build dependency to elasticsearch 2.3.2 #1084

## Improvements
- `Elastica\Type->deleteByQuery($query, $options)` $query param can be a query `array` again https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/issues/1072 #1073
- `Elastica\Client->connect()` allows to establish a connection to ES server when the config was set using method `Elastica\Client->setConfigValue()` https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/issues/1076 #1077
- Elastica\Client constructor now accepts a LoggerInterface and will log both successful and failed requests. #1069

## Deprecated
- Configuring the logger in \Elastica\Client $config constructor is deprecated and will be removed. Use the $logger argument instead. #1069
- Extracted creation of ResultSet objects to a new dedicated ResultSet\Builder implementation. #1065

## Deprecated
- All properties in the \Elastica\ResultSet class will be moved to private in 4.0. To manipulate the creation of a ResultSet, implement the \Elastica\ResultSet\BuilderInterface and pass your new Builder to the \Elastica\Search instances. #1065
