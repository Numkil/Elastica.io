[Elastica 3.2.1](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/tree/3.2.1) ([download](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/releases/tag/3.2.1)).

This release is compatible with Elasticsearch 2.x and was tested with [elasticsearch 2.3.2](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/release-notes-2.3.2.html).


## Backward Compatibility Fixes
- Reintroduced properties in ResultSet removed in 3.2.0 as deprecated properties to be removed in 4.0

## Bugfixes
- Fix fatal error on `Query::addScriptField()` if scripts were already set via `setScriptFields()` [#1086](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1086)
- Fix namespace collision of `Type` in `Query\Ids` [#1104](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1104)

## Added
- Added the concept of ResultSet Transformers. The Transformer adds more information to a Result, for example the original object or data that created the Result. [#1066](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica/pull/1066)
- Tidied property initialisation in classes where it was duplicated
