Versions
--------

The version numbers are consistent with elasticsearch. The version number 0.16.0.0 means it is the first release for elasticsearch version 0.16.0. The next release is called 0.16.0.1. As soon as the elasticsearch is updated and the client is updated, also the next version is called 0.16.1.0. Like this it should be always clear to which versions the Elastica client is compatible.

Compatibilitiy
--------------
Elastica is tested with PHP 5.4 and later. Most functionality still works with PHP 5.3 but future support is not guaranteed. It Versions prior and equal to v0.19.8.0 are compatible with PHP 5.2


File indexing
-------------

File upload is supported but the mapper attachement plugin has to be installed

```
./bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/1.9.0
```
